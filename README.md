### Background

A long time ago, I helped start a company that is now called [InLoop](https://www.inloop.com.au).  I was founding CTO which means you do a lot of different things when you're only 3 people, but eventually we had over 100 people which meant doing lots of different different things.  We launched a few successful products ([Flexischools](https://www.flexischools.com.au) and [LanternPay](https://lanternpay.com)) and in 2021 I stepped away from day to day with InLoop to start doing different different things.

I now help startups and engineering teams through a boutique/personal consultancy service called [Dev Cycles Technology Advisory](https://devcycles.io/page/consulting/).  I help startups get started with their technology aspirations, and software engineering teams with difficult problems like architecture, design, engineering process and retaining their agility as they grow.

[Get in touch](https://devcycles.io/page/contact/) if you want some help!

When not doing that, I'm working on [Contextive](https://github.com/dev-cycles/contextive) - an open source IDE extension to help developers working on complex domains by encouring the use of a Ubiquitous Language.
